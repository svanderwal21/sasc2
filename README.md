This is the project page for my internship project at LUMC, department clinical genetics at SASC for the Hogeschool Leiden

In this project I will dive into how AI can be used in computational biology, in specific pathway analysis

In the first part of this project I will compare GPT4 GUI vs API vs original GO pathway data

In the second part I will choose an open source model from HuggingFace and fine-tune on demain specific data from for example WikiPathways

I will also explore different kinds of models such as BERT for classifying or for QA.

I am learning how to run models, fine-tune and train them, how they work from the ground up, and a lot more Linux and command line related stuff like how to work with SLURM.

Workflow for fine-tuning model
1. Choose a model from HuggingFace(compare results of models against good results from GPT4 with semantic similarity)
2. Download dataset and prepare for training / fine-tuning
3. Fine-tune model and test performance
4. Try lots of different datasets of different websites, databases, sizes and combinations and test performance
5. Report on performance
6. Write in report
